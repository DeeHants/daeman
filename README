DaeMan

DaeMan is a MySQL and PHP based server management system. It can control 
the operation of Apache, Sendmail, Named, and various other services 
running on several distributed servers.

WARNING

Installation

The schema.sql is the schema for the database used by DaeMan. It will 
automatically create an admin user which can be renamed/deleted as 
appropriate. The default password is daeman. You will need to create an 
entry in the Servers table with the short hostname of your server before 
running the update scripts

The website (daemanfe) uses PHP and currently requires a virtual host of 
its own.

The daemand scripts all need to be in the same directory, and the 
updateall script can be run via cron as it will only restart services if 
necessary.

The DaeMan scripts will need to use a base file for all the config, and it
will copy your existing config files to .static and use them as the base
for the auto generated config files before it overwrites the originals

The DaeMan config files can be shared between the website and update 
scripts.
