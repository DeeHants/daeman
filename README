DaeMan

DaeMan is a MySQL and PHP based server management system. It can control 
the operation of Apache, Sendmail, Named, and various other services 
running on several distributed servers.

WARNING

Make copies of all the config files mentioned in the DaeMan config file 
and call them filename.static. The DaeMan scripts will use these as the 
base for the autogenerated config files before it overwrites the originals 

Installation

The schema.sql is the schema for the database used by DaeMan. It will 
automatically create an admin user which can be renamed/deleted as 
appropiate. The default password is daeman. You will need to create an 
entry in the Servers table with the short hostname of your server before 
running the update scripts

The website (daemanfe) uses PHP and currently requires a virtual host of 
its own.

The daemand scripts all need to be in the same directory, and the 
updateall script can be run via cron as it will only restart services if 
necassary.

The config files can be shared between the website and update scripts.
